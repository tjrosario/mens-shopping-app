  {
    question: 'How does ThreadLab work?',
    answer: `<h3>1. Sign up</h3>
        <p>Signing up for ThreadLab is free and takes about a minute. We ask for basic information like size, weight, age, desired price ranges, brands you like and the colors/patterns you wear. This helps us understand your sizes, preferences and budget. You can update this information any time in Your Account.</p>

        <h3>2. Place an order (any time) or set up a Subscription</h3>
        <p>Simply select the Product Categories you need and how much you’re looking to spend, and we’ll find the best products for you. We offer an optional Order Preview by email if you’d like to see the items we’ve selected for you. You can edit the selection before we ship. If you prefer a surprise assortment of items, you can opt out of the Order Preview. We are flexible and customer-friendly.</p>

        <h3>3. Shipment arrives</h3>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>a. Try everything on (minus the socks and underwear.)</li>
          <li>b. Returns must be in new condition with tags and no signs of wear.</li>
          <li>c. Check out by logging into Your Account and clicking on your order in Order History. Request exchanges and provide feedback on any items so that your future orders will be even more precise.</li>
          <li>d. If you decide you need to return, or exchange something, no problem. We always include a self-sealing pre-paid UPS label.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>4. Give feedback that makes the service even better for you</h3>
        <p>Provide as much feedback as possible on every item. We give you a chance to provide feedback at Order Preview and once your order arrives. This way our system learns more about you and the clothes that will work best, making your future ordering even easier.  Additionally, you can always give us more details about your preferences by refining your Product Preferences or Brand Preferences in Your Account.</p>`
